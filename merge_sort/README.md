## Merge Sort Implementation in C

This document describes a C implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique known for its efficiency.

### Features

* **Efficient:** Implements the top-down Merge Sort algorithm for optimal performance.
* **Correct:** Thoroughly tested to ensure accurate sorting of integer arrays.
* **Clear:** Includes detailed comments to explain each step of the algorithm.
* **Easy to use:** Provides a user-friendly `merge_sort` function and a demonstration in `main`.
* **Memory-efficient:** Only uses `malloc` and `free` once as required.

### Usage

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Compile the `merge_sort.c` file:**

   ```bash
   gcc merge_sort.c -o merge_sort
